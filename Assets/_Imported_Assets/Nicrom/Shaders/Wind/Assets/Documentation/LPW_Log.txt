- Moved the shader nodes that simulate the wind to a shader function. 

- Fixed custom material inspector not being applied.

- Rebuild the GUIDs. If LPW already exists in the project, it is recommended that you delete it from your project before you import the new version.
  If you are using LPW shaders in your project, after you import the new update you may see pink materials, even after you import the upgrade package.
  To fix this, select the materials that use LPW shaders and reassign them.
